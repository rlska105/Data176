The general idea behind the fusion is that the GMF better generates the linear dependencies and the MLP better models the non-linear dependencies of in the user-item interactions. Here the MLP’s item and user vectors and GMF layer’s user and item vectors are separately trained, so, that they can reach individual optimality."
